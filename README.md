# AES-Asm

This is a simple demonstration of the ASE-NI instructions in use in assembly, distributed under the GNU GPL V3 License.
It is mostly a proof of concept piece, and is heavily commented for easy readability. It can be easily called from C(++) for
greater ease of use. This is specifically designed for Linux 64 bit and now Windows 64 bit. To build for another environment, one would need to consider
the way in which C(++) will pass arguments in this environment and that the use of registers xmm8 (which is used once because laziness)
and r8 are only available in 64bit (as well as change all general registers to their respective 32 bit form).

The assembly is written in Intel syntax and is intended to be compiled with NASM.
